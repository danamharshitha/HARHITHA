<p1>Gurukul or Gurukulam is a type of education system in ancient India1. It was a residential schooling system whose origin dates back to around 5000 BC in the Indian subcontinent2. The system had three basic pillars- the Acharya or the teacher, the Shishya or the student and the ashram or the place where they interacted3. Students lived near or with the guru in the same house for a period of time where they learned and got educated by their guru1.</p>
